# Tools

The tools package is a collection of utility functions for working with the components. Currently this is the home of two important pieces: 
* a loader of Visualize.js
* TypeScript interfaces for working with Visualize.js in your IDE (work in progress)

## Installation

Installing the tools package can be done with your package tool:  

**npm**  
`npm install @jaspersoft/jv-tools`

**yarn**  
`yarn add @jaspersoft/jv-tools`
