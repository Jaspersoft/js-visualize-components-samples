# TypeScript Types

The jv-tools package also exports some types that can be used while writing TypeScript. Currently this is under development, but some types are availble for use now.

# Using types in your project

The types are exported in the jv-tools package, and should be available in your IDE once you've added `@jaspersoft/jv-tools` as a dependency to your project.
