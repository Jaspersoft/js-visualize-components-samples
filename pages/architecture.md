# Architecture

Jaspersoft Visualize Components repository contains several component packages. This page gives an overview of each component.

### jv-tools
The jv-tools package provides utility methods for interacting with JasperReports Server to obtain visualize scripts. Additionally, this package exports types for the Visualize.js API for TypeScript developers to make type-based inferences while coding for Visualize.js.

### jv-input-controls
The jv-input-controls package provides users the ability to work with a report or Ad Hoc view's input controls. The user can supply a URI to the resource, and this package can render the controls, allow for user input, provide validation, and interact with other components as the values are changed.
    

### jv-scheduler
The jv-scheduler package provides users with the ability to render the workflow for viewing, editing, and creating scheduled tasks.
