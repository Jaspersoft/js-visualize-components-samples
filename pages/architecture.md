# Components

The Visualize Components toolkit is composed of several components:

1. jv-tools

    The jv-tools package provides utility methods for interacting with JRS to obtain visualize scripts. Additionally this package exports types for the visualize.js API for typescript developers to make type-based inferences while coding for visualize

1. jv-input-controls

    The jv-input-controls package provides users the ability to work with a report or ad hoc view's input controls. The user can supply a URI to the resource, and this package can render the controls, allow for user input, provide validation, and interact with other components as the values are changed.
    

1. jv-scheduler

    The jv-scheduler package provides users with the ability to render the work flow for viewing, editing and creating scheduled tasks. 
    
# Applications

The toolkit is intended to be used in existing applications, or to construct a new application composed of these components.
